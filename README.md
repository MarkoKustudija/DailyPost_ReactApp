<p>This is the App writen in JS with React framework that imitate Social Network App's where you can write a post or comment on post if you are registered and logged in user. For now it's using dummy back-end (Firebase). In the future this app will be extended with backend writen in Java. For security reasons authentication doesn't work if you try on your computer beacuse I didn't put API keys.</p>
